        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I’m a 20-year-old web developer in my first year of coding, deeply passionate about learning and growing in the field. My journey began with a curiosity about how websites are built and how I could create something from scratch. That spark has turned into a commitment to learning new programming languages, frameworks, and tools every day. I’m excited by the challenges of web development—whether it’s debugging code, enhancing user experience, or experimenting with creative design solutions. Each project helps me grow, and I’m always looking for new opportunities to refine my skills.

            Outside of coding, I find balance in playing basketball. The sport helps me stay active and sharp, teaching me valuable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Whether it's a casual game with friends or shooting hoops to clear my mind, basketball offers a refreshing break from the screen. Music is another major part of my life, providing inspiration and a creative outlet. I enjoy exploring different genres, which often fuels new ideas when I'm working on web design or solving problems. 
            
            Overall, I’m excited about my future as a web developer and am eager to continue learning, growing, and challenging myself in both tech and life.</p>
